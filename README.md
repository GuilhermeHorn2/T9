# T9

: On old cell phones, users typed on a numeric keypad and the phone would provide a list of
words that matched these numbers. Each digit mapped to a set of O - 4 letters. Implement an algorithm to return a list of matching words, given a sequence of digits. You are provided a list of valid
words (provided in whatever data structure you'd like). The mapping is shown in the diagram below:

1
4
ghi
7
pqrs
2 3
abc def
5 6
jkl mno
8 9
